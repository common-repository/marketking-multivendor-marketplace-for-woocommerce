üéâ *"An excellent plugin. You can find all your needs. I would definitely recommend."*

üéâ *"The level of everything is awesome! I predict this will be the "go to" marketplace platform in the next 6+ months..!"*

üéâ *"Bought it for $139, but it's worth $1390."*

üéâ *"This is one of the best multi vendor plugin, if not the best. I was using WCFM Ultimate plugin on my site - it's a great plugin but it is cluttered. It also needs a lot of plugins for it to be fully functional. Plus, you will pay an annual fee to keep it going. WCFM also has a MASSIVE DATABASE FOOTPRINT - Creates about 36 tables on the database. So I moved to MarketKing - So far I am ecstatic with the plugin features and support from the WebWizardsDev Team"*

üéâ *"Envato is asking me to select one reason before rating but actually this plugin is 5 stars in every criteria. Dozens of modules are available to customize or enhance the features of this multi vendor plugin, the UX/UI is amazing and it just works. The support is superior. The speed of development or bug fixing is super fast. Forget about the others like Dokan, WC Vendors and what else is existing. They lack in every criteria I described above since I used and tested each of them. This plugin is done thoroughly and with perfection in mind. I hope this plugin gets the attention and support it deserves."*

üéâ *"Awesome plugins! The customer support team is very supportive. I have purchased both MarketKing and B2BKing. I think this is the best deal to get an alternate of Dookan etc. All plugins are translatable and have a decent vendor dashboard. I will keep updating this review."*

üéâ *"I run a membership site that is complicated. I've been looking for a Multi Vendor plugin for almost 2 years and I had my eyes set on Dokan Pro (Business level). I've compared a lot of the available Multi Vendor Plugins and I must say you get A LOT for your money with this plugin. I was lucky enough to come across this when it was on sale, what a bargain! - Love it and would highly recommend it to everyone.*
